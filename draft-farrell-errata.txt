                      Something Better Than Errata
                        draft-farrell-errata-00

Abstract

   This document outlines some ideas for a system that would (in the
   author's view) be better than current errata handling.  This is for
   discussion and is not expected to become an RFC.

1.  Introduction

   Current handling of errata for RFCs is a pain, for all concerned, and
   is also fairly ineffective in terms of soliciting comment on RFCs,
   arriving at new text when errors are discovered, likely to see many
   errata not be processed or be processed at glacial speed, and the
   current system is also terrible at making changes visible to RFC
   readers.  It's basically a mess.

   In this draft, we sugggest an alternative way of handling the
   discussion and dispositon of errors in RFC text.  We maintain the
   idea that this system aims only to correct errors in RFC text, but is
   not indended to provide a new route for revision of RFCs.

   For simplicity, we describe the system as if it existed.  We make no
   real effort to determine if putting such a system in place would be
   very easy or very hard and expensive.  We also describe the system as
   if everyone reads RFCs via the datatracker.

   The author is not invested in the details here, anything
   approximating what's described here would probably be fine.

2.  The New System

   Once an RFC is published, then, on the datatracker web page for
   viewing that RFC, there will be a "comment/discuss" button that
   allows readers with a datatracker account to submit comments on, or
   questions about, that RFC.  Threaded discussions on comments can
   follow, not unlike issue discussion on github.

   Discussion threads for RFCs can be browsed/searched.

   Discussion threads are expected to be re-directed to an IETF mailing
   list as warranted.  Discussions can be closed if warranted, e.g. as
   off-topic.  A set of users will have relevant powers, probably
   including some new role(s) specifically for managing such discussions
   where nobody else might notice, e.g. on some ancient RFC.

   By default, RFC authors and relevant WG chairs will recieve
   notification when new discussion threads are started.

   Comments can be labelled in various ways, by the original poster or
   by other users with additional privileges, e.g. authors, (former) WG
   chairs, ADs or IRSG members.  The set of priviliges associated with
   this system are expected to change slowly over time and are
   documented at TBD.

   One way to label a specific comment that contains a suggested change
   is as an erratum.

   Comments labelled as errata can be upvoted or downvoted.  Voting
   power can vary depending on the user, with authors of the RFC in
   question, (former) WG chairs, ADs, etc having more voting power.  The
   set of up/down voting rules are expected to change slowly over time
   and are documented at TBD.

   Once a comment labelled as an erratum has sufficient upvotes, then it
   can be approved by a relevant approver.  For the IETF stream any AD
   can mark a sufficiently upvogted erratum as approved.  Two relevant
   WG chairs can also do so if there is a relevant WG that is still open
   or only closed within the previous five years.  If an errata for an
   IETF stream RFC is erroneously approved then that can be reversed by
   an AD.

   It must be possibly to automatically apply the change resulting from
   an erratum before it is approved.  The required formatting may change
   over time and the current requirements are documented at TBD.

   Other streams will define other approval schemes.

   The default HTML view of RFCs will be that with errata applied.  The
   list of applied errata can be viewed via a button, as can any
   conversation leading up to an approval.

3.  Handing existing errata

   Some of the issues arising in migrating to the new system include:

   *  Existing approved errata need to be imported into the new system
      so as to be displayed as if they had been approved.

   *  No action is required with respect to current, posted but
      unprocessed, errata.  If any of those are really useful, they'll
      be remembered or re-discovered.  The expectation is that
      discussions using the new system will be started for some of these
      unprocessed errata and that that will prove to be an easier way to
      finally process the actually useful subset of those.

   The current errata system should remain available in read-only mode
   so that editors revising RFCs can access e.g. relevant HDFU errata.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   Spam comments and flamewars could distract and damage the reputation
   of the RFC series.
